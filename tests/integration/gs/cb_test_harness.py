Test harness that allows us to raise exceptions, change file content,
and record the byte transfer callback sequence, to test various resumable
upload and download cases. The 'call' method of this harness can be passed
as the 'cb' parameter to boto.s3.Key.send_file() and boto.s3.Key.get_file(),
allowing testing of various file upload/download conditions.
