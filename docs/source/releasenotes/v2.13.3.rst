boto v2.13.3
============

:date: 2013/09/16

This release fixes a packaging error with the previous version of boto.
The version ``v2.13.2`` was provided instead of ``2.13.2``, causing things
like ``pip`` to incorrectly resolve the latest release.

That release was only available for several minutes & was removed from PyPI
due to the way it would break installation for users.
