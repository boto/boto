boto v2.9.1
===========

:date: 2013/04/30

Primarily a bugfix release, this release also includes support for the new
AWS Support API.


Features
--------

* AWS Support API - A client was added to support the new AWS Support API. It
  gives programmatic access to Support cases opened with AWS. A short example
  might look like::

    >>> from boto.support.layer1 import SupportConnection
    >>> conn = SupportConnection()
    >>> new_case = conn.create_case(
    ...     subject='Description of the issue',
    ...     service_code='amazon-cloudsearch',
    ...     category_code='performance',
    ...     communication_body="We're seeing some latency from one of our...",
    ...     severity_code='low'
    ... )
    >>> new_case['caseId']
    u'case-...'

  The :ref:`Support Tutorial <support_tut>` has more information on how to use
  the new API. (SHA: 8c0451)
