The goal of boto is to support the full breadth and depth of Amazon
Web Services.  In addition, boto provides support for other public
services such as Google Storage in addition to private cloud systems
like Eucalyptus, OpenStack and Open Nebula.

Boto is developed mainly using Python 2.6.6 and Python 2.7.3 on Mac OSX
and Ubuntu Maverick.  It is known to work on other Linux distributions
and on Windows.  Most of Boto requires no additional libraries or packages
other than those that are distributed with Python.  Efforts are made
to keep boto compatible with Python 2.5.x but no guarantees are made.

Getting Started with Boto

Your credentials can be passed into the methods that create
connections.  Alternatively, boto will check for the existence of the
following environment variables to ascertain your credentials:

**AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** - Your AWS Access Key ID

**AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** - Your AWS Secret Access Key

Credentials and other boto-related settings can also be stored in a
boto config file.  See `this`_ for details.
