************
Introduction
************

Boto is a Python package that provides interfaces to Amazon Web Services.
At the moment, boto supports:

* Simple Storage Service (S3)
* SimpleQueue Service (SQS)
* Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
* Mechanical Turk
* SimpleDB
* CloudFront
* CloudWatch
* AutoScale
* Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
* Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
* Elastic Map Reduce (EMR)
* Relational Data Service (RDS)
* Simple Notification Server (SNS)
* Google Storage
* Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* Route53 DNS Service (route53)
* Simple Email Service (SES)
* Flexible Payment Service (FPS)
* CloudFormation
* Amazon DynamoDB
* Amazon SimpleWorkflow
* CloudSearch
* Marketplace Web Services

The goal of boto is to support the full breadth and depth of Amazon
Web Services.  In addition, boto provides support for other public
services such as Google Storage in addition to private cloud systems
like Eucalyptus, OpenStack and Open Nebula.

Boto is developed mainly using Python 2.6.6 and Python 2.7.1 on Mac OSX
and Ubuntu Maverick.  It is known to work on other Linux distributions
and on Windows.  Boto requires no additional libraries or packages
other than those that are distributed with Python.  Efforts are made
to keep boto compatible with Python 2.5.x but no guarantees are made.

To see what has changed over time in boto, you can check out the
`release notes`_ in the wiki.

*********************************
Special Note for Python 3.x Users
*********************************

If you are interested in trying out boto with Python 3.x, check out the
`neo`_ branch.  This is under active development and the goal is a version
of boto that works in Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.x.  Not everything is working
just yet but many things are and it's worth a look if you are an active
Python 3.x user.

Your credentials can be passed into the methods that create
connections.  Alternatively, boto will check for the existance of the
following environment variables to ascertain your credentials:

**AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** - Your AWS Access Key ID

**AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** - Your AWS Secret Access Key

Credentials and other boto-related settings can also be stored in a
boto config file.  See `this`_ for details.
