Handler for Google Cloud Storage resumable uploads. See
http://code.google.com/apis/storage/docs/developer-guide.html#resumable
for details.

Resumable uploads will retry failed uploads, resuming at the byte
count completed by the last upload attempt. If too many retries happen with
no progress (per configurable num_retries param), the upload will be
aborted in the current process.

The caller can optionally specify a tracker_file_name param in the
ResumableUploadHandler constructor. If you do this, that file will
save the state needed to allow retrying later, in a separate process
(e.g., in a later run of gsutil).
