class ResultSet(list):
    """
    The ResultSet is used to pass results back from the Amazon services
    to the client.  It has an ugly but workable mechanism for parsing
    the XML results from AWS.  Because I don't really want any dependencies
    on external libraries, I'm using the standard SAX parser that comes
    with Python.  The good news is that it's quite fast and efficient but
    it makes some things rather difficult.

    You can pass in, as the marker_elem parameter, a list of tuples.
    Each tuple contains a string as the first element which represents
    the XML element that the resultset needs to be on the lookout for
    and a Python class as the second element of the tuple.  Each time the
    specified element is found in the XML, a new instance of the class
    will be created and popped onto the stack.
