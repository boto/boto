Boto is a Python package that provides interfaces to Amazon Web Services.
At the moment, boto supports:

 * Simple Storage Service (S3)
 * SimpleQueue Service (SQS)
 * Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
 * Mechanical Turk
 * SimpleDB
 * CloudFront
 * CloudWatch
 * AutoScale
 * Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
 * Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
 * Elastic Map Reduce (EMR)
 * Relational Data Service (RDS) 
 * Simple Notification Server (SNS)
 * Google Storage

The intent is to support additional services in the future.

The goal of boto is to provide a very simple, easy to use, lightweight
wrapper around the Amazon services.  Not all features supported by the
Amazon Web Services will be supported in boto.  Basically, those
features I need to do what I want to do are supported first.  Other
features and requests are welcome and will be accomodated to the best
of my ability.  Patches and contributions are welcome!

Boto was written using Python 2.6.5 on Mac OSX.  It has also been tested
on Linux Ubuntu using Python 2.6.5.  Boto requires no additional
libraries or packages other than those that are distributed with Python 2.6.5.
Efforts are made to keep boto compatible with Python 2.4.x but no
guarantees are made.

Your credentials can be passed into the methods that create 
connections.  Alternatively, boto will check for the existance of the
following environment variables to ascertain your credentials:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - Your AWS Access Key ID
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - Your AWS Secret Access Key

Credentials and other boto-related settings can also be stored in a boto config
file.  See:

for details.
